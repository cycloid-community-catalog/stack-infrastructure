## Stack templates READMEs

When using stack templates, the README file of the template will be copied over to the stacks generated.  
Like for other files of a template, it is possible to use `pongo2` templating inside the template `README.md` file. It will be compiled when users generate a stack from it.

Some variables are exposed and can be used in READMEs to generate dynamic content.
